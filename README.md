# E-Commerce Master Layer — dbt Project

A dbt project that implements a canonical master data layer for an e-commerce domain,
built on top of raw data landed by a Fivetran-like ingestion tool.

Supports two targets out of the box:
- **DuckDB** — local development, no credentials needed
- **Snowflake** — production target, configured via environment variables

---

## Stack

| Tool | Version | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| dbt-core | 1.10.20 | Transformation framework |
| dbt-duckdb | 1.10.0 | Local development target |
| dbt-snowflake | 1.10.0 | Production target |
| Python | 3.9+ | Runtime |

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone & create a virtual environment
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Configure credentials (Snowflake only)
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Fill in your Snowflake values in .env
```

### 3. Run the pipeline

Use `make` from the `ecommerce_master/` directory:

```bash
# DuckDB (local, no credentials needed)
make run_ecommerce_duckdb

# Snowflake (requires .env)
make run_ecommerce_snowflake
```

Each command will:
1. Run `scripts/clean_csv.py` to sanitise CSV column names
2. Load the seed file into the target warehouse (`dbt seed`)
3. Build all models (`dbt run`)

---

## Snowflake Setup (first time only)

Before running against Snowflake, a one-time setup is required to create the
database, schemas, warehouse, role, and user that dbt expects.

Run `scripts/snowflake_setup.sql` in a Snowflake worksheet **as ACCOUNTADMIN**
(or any role with `CREATE` privileges):

```sql
-- in Snowflake UI or SnowSQL:
-- 1. Open scripts/snowflake_setup.sql
-- 2. Replace <your_password> with the DBT_USER password
-- 3. Run the entire script
```

This creates:
| Object | Name |
|---|---|
| Warehouse | `COMPUTE_WH` |
| Database | `ECOMMERCE` |
| Schemas | `RAW`, `STAGING`, `MASTER` |
| Role | `TRANSFORMER` |
| User | `DBT_USER` |

Once done, fill in your `.env` with the credentials from the setup script and run:
```bash
make run_ecommerce_snowflake
```

---

## Environment Variables

All sensitive values are read from a `.env` file (never hardcoded). Create one from the example:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `SNOWFLAKE_ACCOUNT` | Snowflake account identifier |
| `SNOWFLAKE_USER` | Snowflake username |
| `SNOWFLAKE_PASSWORD` | Snowflake password |
| `SNOWFLAKE_ROLE` | Role (default: `TRANSFORMER`) |
| `SNOWFLAKE_DATABASE` | Database (default: `ECOMMERCE`) |
| `SNOWFLAKE_WAREHOUSE` | Warehouse (default: `COMPUTE_WH`) |
| `DBT_TARGET` | Active target — `duckdb` or `snowflake` (default: `duckdb`) |

```

## Cross-Database Compatibility

Models use a custom `parse_date` macro that dispatches to the correct
function per adapter:

| Adapter | Function used |
|---|---|
| DuckDB | `strptime(col, '%d-%m-%Y')::date` |
| Snowflake | `TO_DATE(col, 'DD-MM-YYYY')` |

To add support for another adapter, add a `<adapter>__parse_date` implementation
in `macros/parse_date.sql`.

---

## Assumptions

1. **Currency:** Source prices are labelled in `Rs.` (Rupees) but treated as USD
   per exercise instructions. Conversion to GBP uses a fixed rate of 0.75.
2. **Single source table:** The dataset has one flat CSV combining users, products,
   and orders. In production these would be separate source tables landed by Fivetran.
3. **Order identity:** A transaction is uniquely identified by
   `(user_id, product_id, purchase_date)`. No explicit order ID exists in the source.
4. **No status transitions:** The dataset has no order status field.
   Late-arriving updates are addressed in the design notes below.
5. **DuckDB schema naming:** DuckDB prefixes custom schemas with the database name
   (`main_staging`, `main_master`). This is adapter behaviour and does not affect
   model logic — on Snowflake schemas will be `staging` and `master` as expected.

---

## Design Choices

### Multi-target profiles (no `~/.dbt` required)
`profiles/profiles.yml` is passed via `--profiles-dir ./profiles`.
Anyone can clone the repo and run immediately without touching `~/.dbt/profiles.yml`.
Credentials are never hardcoded — all sensitive values come from environment variables.

### Deterministic keys (MD5)
All master entities use `md5(source_id)` as their surrogate key. This ensures:
- The same source record always produces the same master key (idempotent)
- Keys are consistent across full refreshes and backfills
- Foreign keys in `master_orders` are computed with the same function, guaranteeing
  referential integrity without joins at build time

### Layered architecture (staging → master)
- **Staging** (`view`): light rename/cast layer, no business logic
- **Master** (`table`): deduplicated, enriched, ready for consumption

### Category normalisation
`lower(trim(category))` in `master_products` prevents duplicate categories
caused by inconsistent capitalisation or whitespace in the source.

### Deduplication strategy
- `master_users`: `distinct` on `user_id` — each user appears once
- `master_products`: `row_number() over (partition by product_id order by purchase_date desc)`
  — keeps the most recent product attributes
- `master_orders`: `row_number() over (partition by user_id, product_id, purchase_date)`
  — removes exact duplicates while preserving all distinct transactions

---

## Design Notes

### SCD2 — best candidates in master_products
The following attributes are most likely to change over time and benefit from SCD2 tracking:
- `price_usd` — prices change frequently
- `discount_pct` — promotional discounts are temporary
- `category` — products can be recategorised

Implementation would add `valid_from`, `valid_to`, and `is_current` columns,
using dbt snapshots (`strategy: timestamp` or `strategy: check`).

### Late-arriving updates (status transitions, cancellations, refunds)
In a production pipeline with order status transitions the recommended approach is:
1. **Append-only raw table** — never mutate source records; each status change
   arrives as a new row with a timestamp
2. **`row_number()` deduplication** on `(order_id, updated_at desc)` in staging
   to surface the latest status per order
3. **Incremental models** (`materialized: incremental`, `unique_key: order_master_id`)
   in master to merge late arrivals without full table rebuilds
4. **Refunds** modelled as a separate `master_refunds` entity referencing
   `order_master_id`, keeping the original order record immutable

---

## What I Would Extend Next

1. **Currency seed** — a `seeds/exchange_rates.csv` with daily USD→GBP rates
   joined on `purchase_date` instead of a fixed 0.75 rate
2. **Incremental models** — replace full table refreshes with
   `materialized: incremental` on `master_orders` for production scalability
3. **GDPR delete handling** — a `deleted_users` seed/table checked in
   `master_users` to null out PII fields on matched `user_source_id`
4. **dbt Elementary** — open-source observability package for automated
   anomaly detection and a data health dashboard
5. **Reusable macros** — `generate_surrogate_key()` macro to standardise
   MD5 key generation across all models
